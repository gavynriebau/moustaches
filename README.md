# Moustaches

This is a technical demo [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) site that uses the [HTML5 canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) to provide the ability to modify images by adding a moustache to them.

* [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) is used as the site's engine.
* [Multer Middleware](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) is used for handling image uploads
* [HTML5 canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) is used for rendering an image and producing a new image that has a moustache overlayed onto it.

To run this locally run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
